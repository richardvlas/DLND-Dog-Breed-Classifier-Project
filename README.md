## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, I made important design decisions about the user experience for the app. By completing this lab, one can understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  The imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
